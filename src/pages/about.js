            Hi, my name is Jillian, aka the person writing the blogs (thus
            "jillianblogs"--creative, right?). Depending on your preference of
            social media, my bio could contain any of the following:

          <SocialQuote>
            I rarely take pictures of food; by the time I think of it, I've
            already finished eating. Priorities, you know?

            I'm a product of the Midwest US, but in the last few years I've
            lived in Barcelona and, more recently, Berlin. In college in
            Minnesota, I studied Spanish and Psychology with a focus on
            neuroscience, but considering the job market it should be no
            surprise that I wound up in a completely unrelated field (insurance)
            <span role="img" aria-label="woman shrugging emoji">

          </p>
          <p>
            After moving to Europe, I had the unique opportunity to redefine my
            career path. I chose to cultivate a new set of skills and become a
            web developer. I've been a software developer for about a year and a
            half now, and I'm still thrilled with my choice to make the switch

          <p>
            There is one thing I would change if I could, though: diversity and
            inclusion in the tech world is dismal (at best) and the (infrequent)
            conversations around these problems are disappointingly shallow. The
            more I see this problem, the more passionate I become about doing my
            small part to correct the imbalances. I am always ready to encourage
            and empower members of underrepresented groups to enter and become
            successful in the tech industry, and I am committed to using
            whatever leverage and/or platform I have to make it a more inclusive
            and welcoming space.
          </p>
          <p>
            My other passions: rock climbing, public speaking (yes, really),
            checking out hipster coffee spots, trying to cook meals that are
            better than merely edible, and traveling as much as my schedule
            allows.

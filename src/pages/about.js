            Hi, my name is Jillian, aka the person writing the blogs (thus
            "jillianblogs"--creative, right?). Depending on your preference of
            social media, my bio could contain any of the following:

            I rarely take pictures of food; by the time I think of it, I've
            already finished eating. Priorities, you know?

            American as Berlin will allow‚úåüèª

          <SocialQuote>OK but is there gonna be food</SocialQuote>

            I'm a product of the Midwest US, but in the last few years I've
            lived in Barcelona and, more recently, Berlin. In college in
            Minnesota, I studied Spanish and Psychology with a focus on
            neuroscience, but considering the job market it should be no
            surprise that I wound up in a completely unrelated field (insurance)

            After moving to Europe, I had the unique opportunity to redefine my
            career path. I chose to cultivate a new set of skills and become a
            web developer. I've been a software developer for about a year and a
            half now, and I'm still thrilled with my choice to make the switch

            My only complaint? Diversity and inclusion in the tech world could
            use some improvement. I've become passionate about encouraging and
            empowering other women to enter into and succeed in the industry.

            My other passions: rock climbing, public speaking (yes, really),
            checking out hipster coffee spots, trying to cook meals that are
            better than merely edible, and traveling as much as my schedule
            allows.
